CREATING YOUR OWN REPO:

1. git init (inside of exaftly where you want your git created)
2. Go into Git Hub and create the repo in browser
3. git remote add origin (url) ... the URL is 
    what you just created in the browser
4. git add . for all files OR git add (fileName) to add just one
    file at a time
5. git commit -m "with some message" created a message that actually
    shows up on Github and can be seen by potential employers on the repo
6. git push origin (nameOfBranch) and for now, the name of the 
    branch is almost always main or mastercd 

FORKING AND CLONING TO SUBMIT MY HOMEWORK:
1. Fork the repo over to your own version. This is because you 
    don't have access to push to GA's org but you will be able to
    push to your own.
2.  Clone it down FROM YOUR FORKED VERSION. MAke syre tge URL that
    you're cloning has your name and not SEI-NYC-1114.
3. Make my changes
4. git add (file or . for all)
5. git commit -m "Something not for latenightcommits.com"
6. git push origin master ...git push should work itself
7. Go to the pull requests tab in the browser. It should be 
    right next to the code tab on the top. Click new pull request.
    Instead of the note that you put, please put your name.
