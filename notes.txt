CREATING YOUR OWN REPO:

1. git init (inside of exaftly where you want your git created)
2. Go into Git Hub and create the repo in browser
3. git remote add origin (url) ... the URL is 
    what you just created in the browser
4. git add . for all files OR git add (fileName) to add just one
    file at a time
5. git commit -m "with some message" created a message that actually
    shows up on Github and can be seen by potential employers on the repo
6. git push origin (nameOfBranch) and for now, the name of the 
    branch is almost always main or master
